# Housing-Data project

Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a housing dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about different housing attributes, and the goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, insights, and relationships within the data. The findings can help guide decisions in real estate pricing, prediction models, or other housing-related analyses.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features related to houses, including prices, square footage, location, number of rooms, and more. This dataset is commonly used for practice in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

You can access the dataset here on Kaggle.

Installation

1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Run the data cleaning script to preprocess the raw data:

python scripts/preprocess_data.py
This will clean the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare the data for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The core of this project is in the Jupyter notebook located in notebooks/eda_housing.ipynb. To run the notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open notebooks/eda_housing.ipynb and execute the cells to perform the EDA.
3. Visualizations
Visualizations will be saved in the visualizations/ folder. They include charts like price distributions, correlation heatmaps, and feature vs target variable plots.

Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
You can install all the dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
